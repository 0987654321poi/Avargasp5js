CSCI201 Final video
This is the first part of my CSCI201 final video. I edited professor Meng's p5js file to make the program red and green themed for Christmas break.
I also added borers to the "balls" because I thought this looked cool and I changed the balls to squares just to mess around. I also changed the bounce
mechanics so that not only does one velocity change when a ball hits a wall, but both do.
